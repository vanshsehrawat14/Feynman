# Feynman — One Pager

**Tagline:** *3Blue1Brown makes one video a month. Feynman makes one in two minutes. On anything.*

---

## What It Is
AI-powered platform that generates 3Blue1Brown-style educational videos on demand. Type any math/CS topic → get a 3–5 min animated video with geometric intuition.

## The Problem
- ChatGPT = text only. No visual intuition.
- YouTube = static videos. Weeks to produce.
- Math needs *seeing* the geometry, not just reading formulas.

## The Solution
Manim + Groq + React. Same tool as 3B1B. Type "eigenvalues" → 2 min later, you have a visual explanation.

## Nevada Angle
- Nevada: 48th in US education
- CCSD: among the most underfunded districts
- Feynman = personalized visual learning for every student, regardless of resources

## Demo Hook
"Raise your hand if you understood eigenvalues the first time." *Most hands down.* "Watch." *Play video.*

## Why It Wins
**Instant visual intuition.** No tutor, no expensive course — just type and watch.
