# Feynman — Slide Outline (5–6 slides)

Use this as a rough guide if you build slides (Google Slides, Figma, etc.).

---

### Slide 1: Title
- **FEYNMAN**
- Subtitle: *3Blue1Brown-style videos in 2 minutes. On anything.*
- Optional: simple logo or Manim-style graphic

---

### Slide 2: The Problem
- "Math needs visual intuition — not just formulas"
- ChatGPT: text only ❌
- YouTube: great but static, one video per month ❌
- Most students never get the "aha" moment

---

### Slide 3: The Solution
- **Feynman** = type any topic → get animated video
- Same tool as 3B1B (Manim)
- AI generates script + animation in ~2 min
- Screenshot of your app with chips + video

---

### Slide 4: Live Demo
- "Raise your hand if you've taken linear algebra"
- "Keep it raised if you understood eigenvalues the first time"
- *Switch to live app, type eigenvalues, play video*

---

### Slide 5: Nevada Impact
- Nevada ranks 48th in US education
- CCSD among most underfunded districts
- Feynman = visual learning for every student, regardless of resources
- "Same quality for everyone."

---

### Slide 6: Closing
- **"Every student deserves a Feynman."**
- QR code or URL to try it (if deployed)
- Thank you
